\section{Introduction}

In this project we study the price of used cars based on a number of relevant charectaristics. Using regresion analysis tools implemented in the open source language \textit{R} (which is widely used for statistical anlysis), we aim to model the sales price as well as detect correlations between factors. The dataset includes 172 observations of cars with a 12 charecteristics including the following: \textit{price}, in thousands of Euros; \textit{age}, in months; \textit{km}, the total milage in kilometers; \textit{TIA}, the number of months untill the next vehicle inspection. The data also includes dummy variables (which are equal to 1 or 0 depending on whether the factor is true or false) such as \textit{ABS} and \textit{SunRoof} representing the presence of ABS-technology or a sunroof repsectively.
