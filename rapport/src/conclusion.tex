Having taking into consideration model evaluation factors, such as 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{R-squared}
	\item \emph{R-squared adjusted}
	\item \emph{BIC}
	\item \emph{AIC}
	\item \emph{AICc}
	\item and others
\end{itemize}

we chose \textbf{model3} as our model that will best predict the 
used car prices.

Last, but not least, we want to say that even if this project is rather 
``small'', it gave us a great example of how to structually approach a 
modelling problem and how to arrive at a result that is logically well 
founded.
