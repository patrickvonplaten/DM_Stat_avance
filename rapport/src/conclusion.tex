Having taking into consideration model evaluation factors, such as: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{R-squared}
	\item \emph{R-squared adjusted}
	\item \emph{BIC}
	\item \emph{AIC}
	\item \emph{AICc}
	\item and others
\end{itemize}

we chose \textbf{model3} as our model that will best predict the price of used cars.

\begin{equation}
	M_3 = lm(price \sim\ age + km + ageop2 + kop2)
\end{equation}

To conclude, we would like to note that even if this project is rather 
``small'', it gave valuable experience in how to strucuture  an approach to a  
modelling problem and how to arrive at a result that is logically well 
founded.
