\section{Study of price as a function of the prescene of ABS-technology}

COMMENTS: No difference can be seen between those two models, so there doesn't 
seem to be a difference. It may be pertinant remeber that the logical variable
cannot be calculated upon, e.g. we cannot calculate the average of \textit{loglDf\$ABS}. Though this should not make a difference in the final model as regression requires the logical variable to implemented as a dummy variable (i.e. qualitavitely) anyways.

COMMENTS: It clearly can be seen that the variable "ABS" does not account for any of the variance of the price, since it's $R^2$ is very low (0.00097). That means in general that the model does not do a very good job predicting the price
Also, it can be seen that our "Intercept" value nearly completely explains
the price (look at the parameter values or $Pr(>|t|)$). Therefore, our prediction
would just create a constant line (when plotting our pred), showing that the biais is too high.

COMMENT: WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF EACH OF THE NUMBERS WE GET WHEN 
DOING LINEAR REGRESSION! THEN IT IS CLEARER AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCLUSION WE ARE ARRIVING AT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A CERTIAN LINEAR REGRESSION
