Scatterplot shows a relavitely strong correlation between price and age and some correlation between age and km as well as price and km. TIA seems to have no influence on other variables in this model.

The boxplot show that for cars having an ABS the median is significantly high than for cars not having an ABS. Also, the variance of the price of cars having an ABS is much lower than for those that have one.
Since it can be seen that 50\% of all ``ABS'' cars have a price that ranges between 2.6 and 4 with pretty much no ``ABS'' car having a price higher than 6, where as 50\% of all ``Non-ABS'' cars have a price that ranges between 2.5 and 4.5 and a maximum of 7. It can be concluded that the price is somewhat correlated to the dummy variable ABS, but not very strongly.

It can be seen that the medians are quite similar for ``Non-OpenRoof'' and ``OpenRoof'' cars. The ``box range'' around the is smaller for ``OpenRoof'' cars, but apart from that they are no significant differences. In summary, the correlation between price and OpenRoof seems to be rather small, but further analysis is needed.
